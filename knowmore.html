   <center> <h3>What is Data Structure?</h3></center>
    <P><b>Data Structure</b> is a systematic process of organizing and storing the data in the main memory of the computer so that it can be managed properly and utilized efficiently.
         One common example of data structure is a LinkedIn List. </P>

        
        <h3><center>There are two types of Data Structures.</center></h3>
        <p>
        1. <b>Linear Data Structures</b>
        
        If the elements in the Data Structure are arranged in a sequential manner one after the other then it is called a Linear Data Structure.
        
        A sequential arrangement makes it easy to access elements. 
        
        Examples of Linear Data structures are Array, Linked List, Stack, and Queue.</p>
        <p>
         2. <b>Non-linear Data Structures</b>
        
        Unlike Linear Data Structure, if the elements are not arranged in a sequential manner then it is called a Non-Linear Data Structure.
        
        Instead, they’re connected in a hierarchical manner where one element connects to multiple elements. 
        
        Examples of Non-Linear Data Structures are Graphs, Trees. 
    </p>
       <center><h3>Why Data Structure?</h3></center>
       <p>
        Data Structure is the key component of the programming world and helps in solving real-life complex problems.
        
        Data Structures are widely used in AI/ML, operating systems, and other sectors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Understanding Data Structures gives you a clear understanding of how a data-based problem can be solved efficiently. 
        
        Moreover, if you want to land an IT job in your dream company then Data Structures are a must.
        
        Because Data Structure is part of the interview and hiring process.
    </p>
    <p> 
        Product-based companies check for the strength of Data Structures so that you can help them with their day-to-day problems. 
        
        If a candidate is unaware of Data Structures then he’ll not be able to write efficient code.
        
        Based on the project, it’s crucial to choose the right data structure for your project.
